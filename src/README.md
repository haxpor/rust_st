# Build

Use `rustc -o a.out <source-file.rs>`.
This will produce `a.out` executable file as output, so it won't clutter your
space of having different executable file names.

Otherwise you can just normally use `rustc <source-file.rs>`. Depends on your need.

# Note

Each individual source files inside `src/` contains description for what it
demonstrates. Check the source for more detail.
